# NewLayoutCTA

This is the repository for the building of CTA software. 
It is right now open access, this means anyone can access it on the web.

To do list, and assignments:
- save petri dish size and radius in AAC => (Clément, ongoing)
- allow a batch mode analysis for timelapse movies: master folder, goes over all sub folders
- allow user to resize image to smaller one for speed 
        * warning sizes of colonies obtained!
        * One possibility is to directly use a smaller image at loading (but not for analyis?)
- update todo list from Mathilde and Clément prvious discussions => (Clément)
